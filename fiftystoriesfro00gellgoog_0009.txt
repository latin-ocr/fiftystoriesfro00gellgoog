PREFACE.

,Ïˆ-

THIS selection of anecdotes is intended to be used in
practising reading at sight. Many teachers know that the
last few minutes of many a recitation hour can be em-
ployed with more interest, and therefore with more profit,
if the attention of the pupils is refreshed by a change of
subject. In this way also classes may, without any real
sacrifice of time, which at best is very limited, make the
acquaintance of various minor authors, who deserve to be
known, and yet for whom no regular place can be found
in the ordinary curriculum of school or college.

Such is my apology for the issue of the following little
book.

Pinnem-on, December, 1892.
