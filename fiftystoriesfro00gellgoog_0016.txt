xii Introduction

The compilation occupied many years, having been begun not
far from 160 and completed perhaps about 175 Λα). The con—
tents are in the highest degree miscellaneous and the arrangement
is casual- There is a total lack of discrimination as to the value
of what was recorded, and it is surprising to find in the same
collection the priceless account of the conversation of Caecilius
and Favorinus on the laws of the Twelve Tables (XX. ι) and
such an absurdity as the tale of the gigantic serpent which
Regulus' army could subdue only by the use of catapults (see
p. 40).

But the author deserves our gratitude for the honest industry
and conscientious care with which he collected from books and
conversation everything he thought worthy of preservation about
archaic language and literature, about grammar, philosophy, his-
tory, law, and natural science. And his work is the more valu-
able because many of the original sources whence he quoted are
no longer extant.

Considering the age in which he wrote, his diction is sober,
but his antiquarian taste shows itself in numerous archaisms. It
would not be fair to blame him for defects which were not personal
but common to a period when the Romans had generally ceased
to feel the true force of the language which they used. No one
can claim for him a large measure of creative talent, or even
of taste and judgment. Such qualities could not be expected
in an age whose greatest literary light was the pretentious but
insipid Fronto.

But if Aulus Gellius was mediocre and pedantic, he was ami—
able and well-meaning, and as we turn the pages of his miscel-
lany, finding so much to interest men of every taste, we come to
regard with real affection the kindly soul whose patient industry
saved for us so much delightful information.

The following pieces have been chosen, not for their inherent
value, nor even in order to give a fair average view of the Noctes
Atticae, but because their simple, interesting, narrative character
seemed to make them suitable for the purpose indicated in the
preface.
