INTRODUCTION.

4—-

AULUS GELLIUS was a writer of the latter half of the second
century A.D. The little that we know of his life is gathered from
allusions scattered through the Noctes Atticae, apparently the
only work he wrote.

He must have been born about the year 130 A.D.‚ and he lived
under at least three emperorS, — Hadrian, Antoninus Pius, and
Marcus Aurelius. That he was of African origin has been con-

‘· jectured‚ but not proved. He was educated at Rome, and among

his teachers were Sulpicius Apollinaris of Carthage, Antonius
Julianus, T. CastriciuS, and especially Favorinus. Perhaps also
Fronto, whom he greatly admired‚ may be counted among the
number; certainly his influence upon Gellius was strong.

Our author mentions having served asa z'udexin the law courts
at Rome. This must have been when he was not far from twenty-
five. When probably about thirty, he continued his studies at
AthenS, where he was especially attached to the philosopher
Calvisius TauruS‚ and was intimate also with Herodes Atticm,
Peregrinus ProteuS, and other distinguished scholars. It is
not known when he returned to Rome, but he seems to have
devoted his life to the pursuit of literature and learning, and to
have enjoyed the intimacy of a large circle of cultivated men.

The monument of his life work is the Noctes Atticae,' ιη twenty
bookS, all of which are extant, except the eighth, and of that we
fortunately possess the table of contents. The name was chosen,
as the prefaceinforms uS, because the work was begun in the

long evenings of a winter spent in a country house in Attica.
